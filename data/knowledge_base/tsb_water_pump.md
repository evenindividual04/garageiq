## Summary

A revised procedure for water pump replacement has been issued due to reports of premature gasket failure when using the original procedure.

2. **Remove Accessory Belt** - Refer to Section 2.1.
3. **Disconnect Hoses** - Mark orientation before removal.
4. **Remove Water Pump Bolts** - Torque sequence reversed from manual.
5. **Clean Mating Surface** - Use gasket scraper, not wire brush.
6. **Install New Pump** - Use NEW gasket (Part# WP-GASKET-2024).
7. **Refill Coolant** - Use OAT (Organic Acid Technology) coolant ONLY.
8. **Bleed System** - Run engine for 10 mins with heater on MAX.
